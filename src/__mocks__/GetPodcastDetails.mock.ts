        "The Bionic Six is back! With Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show announcement over the weekend, the internet reacted to Lil Wayne not being selected to perform with New Orleans hosting the event (17:25). The JBP debates what songs Wayne would perform before discussing potential reasons as to why the NFL went in a different direction. Off the success and praise of 'Alligator Bites Never Heal', Doechii pulls up to the studio to discuss the creation of her mixtape, working under the TDE umbrella, and where she sees herself over the next five years (1:18:25). Also, Joe asks the room whether mom trucks still exist (2:05:05), Nicki Minaj defends Lil Wayne on X (2:20:26), Joe shares a couple stories from his trip to Indianapolis (2:31:38), bodycam footage has been released of Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill's arrest prior to Sunday's game (2:47:26), and much more!
